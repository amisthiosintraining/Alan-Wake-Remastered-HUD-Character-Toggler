#### Current Issues
- Alan Wake is invisible but leaves behind an invisible shape and shadow.
- Making Alan Wake invisible makes other interactive objects invisible too (npcs, vehicles, doors, manuscripts, etc.)
- Yes, I'm aware that the flashlight does not disappear, that's because if I do big portions of the environmental set up disappears with it.
